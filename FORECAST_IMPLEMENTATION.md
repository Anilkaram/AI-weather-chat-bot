# Weather Bot Forecast Feature - Implementation Plan

## Issue Identified
The weather bot currently has a forecast functionality that's not being used in the n8n workflow. When users ask about future weather, the system always uses the `get_weather` API endpoint regardless of whether they're asking for a forecast.

## Technical Analysis

1. **MCP Server (Python Backend)**
   - The server has two endpoints properly implemented:
     - `get_weather` for current weather
     - `get_forecast` for 5-day forecast
   - Both endpoints correctly handle timezone conversion
   - The forecast formatting has been enhanced to match the current weather style

2. **n8n Workflow**
   - Issue: Always uses `get_weather` regardless of forecast requests
   - The AI prompt correctly identifies forecast intent but the workflow doesn't use it
   - The `tool_name` parameter is hardcoded to `get_weather`

## Implemented Changes

1. **Fixed the n8n workflow configuration**
   - Created an updated workflow file `n8n-workflow-updated.json`
   - Changed the `tool_name` parameter to use conditional logic:
     ```json
     "tool_name": "={{ $json.forecast ? 'get_forecast' : 'get_weather' }}"
     ```
   - Improved the AI prompt to properly identify forecast requests using boolean values

2. **Improved forecast output formatting**
   - Enhanced the forecast format to be more readable
   - Added more weather details per day
   - Made timezone information more consistent between both endpoints

## Implementation Steps

1. Import the updated workflow into n8n:
   - Open the n8n interface at http://localhost:5678
   - Import the workflow from `n8n-workflow-updated.json`
   - Activate the workflow

2. Test the forecast functionality:
   - Try a current weather query: "What's the current weather in Delhi?"
   - Try a forecast query: "What will the weather be like in Delhi tomorrow?"
   - Try a multi-day forecast: "What's the weather forecast for Delhi for the next 5 days?"

## Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced UI for Forecast Display**
   - The forecast response is longer and may need UI adjustments
   - Consider adding a special forecast card in the frontend

2. **Testing Different Query Types**
   - Test various ways users might ask about forecasts
   - Make sure the AI model correctly identifies forecast intent

## Conclusion

The forecast functionality is working correctly in the backend but isn't being called by the n8n workflow. The updated workflow file fixes this issue by dynamically setting the API endpoint based on whether the user is asking for a forecast or current weather.
